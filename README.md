# sudoku
A small project to build a sudoku generator

Done
- Implemented backtracking algorithm to solve a grid and generate sudoku puzzles with unique solutions.
- Built simple GUI to allow user to generate puzzles of different difficulty level and view the solution.
- Implemented an AI solver that utilises constraint propagation to significantly reduce compute time.

To Improve
- Introduce new difficulty ratings based on non-backtracking solving methods, as trial and error is not the desirable required method to solve a sudoku.
- Develop GUI to allow users to place numbers and solve in window.
