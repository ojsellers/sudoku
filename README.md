# sudoku
A small project to build a sudoku generator

Done
- Implemented backtracking algorithm to solve any grid and generate sudoku puzzles with unique solutions.
- Built simple GUI to allow user to generate puzzles of different difficulty level and view the solution.

To Improve
- Could improve backtracking solver by reducing computing time by implementing constraint propagation to give rules to fill in forced values.
- Introduce new difficulty ratings based on non-backtracking solving methods, as trial and error is not the desirable required method to solve a sudoku.
- Develop GUI to allow users to place numbers and solve in window.
